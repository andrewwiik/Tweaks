# Exsto

Exsto is an iOS jailbreak tweak to provide a simple and efficient way to launch apps from within folders. A long press on a folder will pop up a radial menu around your finger containing all of the icons from within the folder. Once the Exsto menu is displayed all you have to do to launch an application is slide to it, and release your finger. Apps with pending notifications will be displayed in the Exsto Menu with a red glow.

Available for purchase on the BigBoss Cydia repository.
